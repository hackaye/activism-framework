#Burn out

In activist (volunteering) organization, initiatives the main source are people. Their enthusiam burnt out earlier or later. For some individuals it is several weeks for others it is several years. But the final is the same for most majority. There are a list of practics for prolonging and postponing this inevitable moment.

* Create atmoshere in a collective for leadship and task changing. For example in one task or campaign one induvidual heads in the next activities another. It gives taem member to change tasks, try something new and do not dive into routine, which is a main reason for burnout. 
* Give time for the rest. Especially, for people who support team infrastructure (server administration, content management, event organization) because the type of tasks usually are more routine and tedious.
* To create an attractable mechanism for transfering organizational skills and knowledge to newcommers or between oldhanded members.
* To discuss together conflict situations. It can help people to foster robust ties in collective and may it stronger. What adds new point for continuing hard working even in not friendly external environment.
* In some case do not scare to change the main approach (method, way) in activism. For example, you distributed leaflets and make thematic discussions, and after your initiative switches on a movies watching club, practical it-meetups or playing in urban games. It can be considered with people which have the main marks of burnout.
