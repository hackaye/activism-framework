# Activism Framework

A collaboratively developed framework for planning activist campaigns, started at MozFest 2015. This project aims to provide a shared resource for anyone approaching the task of planning a new activist campaign.

* advocacy
* [education](Education.md)
* legitimacy
* scaleability
* [organization](Organization.md)
* timeline
