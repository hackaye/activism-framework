# Activism Framework

A collaboratively designed framework for planning activist campaigns. _Started at MozFest 2015._

Elements to think about when planning a campaign:
* [defining the issue](issue.md)
* goals
* [decision-making](decision-making.md)
* [people / stakeholders](people.md)
  * identifying roles (activists, partners, allies, targets, leadership)
* advocacy
* education
* legitimacy
* scaleability
* [organisation](Organization.md)
* timeline
* experiences / rationale
* resources
  * does a framework already exist?
  * good practice - what's worked already?
    * [burnout](burnout.md)
* outcomes
* tactics
  * media
    * identifying social media platforms
  * offline activities
  * identifying audiences
  * call to action
